##### Planning and required analysis
  All the requirements for the project were gathered and collected to create a cloud application for users to upload pictures and trade items. These idea was inspired by a video called trading a bobby pin for a house. 
##### Defining requirements
  I went on into more specific details as to what the application needed to do and how it needed to respond. These details can be found in the README.md
##### Designing 
  This was the most fun out of all the phase since I was able to use a wireframe to decide how the application was going to look. 
##### Implementing & Coding
  The code had to be implemented to meet all the requirements. At this point the end project was nonexistent. 
##### Testing
  This was a phase that was never able to be properly developed with proper test methods and such. 
##### Deployment

  ###### Lessons Leanred
  1. What did you do right?</br>
      There was little to nothing that I did right. The one thing that I did right was use the .NET frameworks to my advantage and the javascript websites for help.
  2. What did you do wrong?</br>
      Not knowing javascript and how to use bootstraps.
  3. Where were you lucky?</br>
      I figured out how to use .NET frameworks to my advantage.
  4. What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?</br>
      I wish I knew that this application was going to require a vast majority of javascript knowledge to successfully complete the application.
